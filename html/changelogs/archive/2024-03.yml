  - rscadd: Use of E621 for headshots, because literally why not?

  Just-Sim:
  - rscdel: Removed old *meow.
  - sounddel: Removed old *meow.ogg
  - rscadd: Added new *meow
  - soundadd: Re-added old meow soundfile as it's needed by vocal barks.
  - rscadd: Added new scream for Felinid subrace.
  - rscdel: Deleted new felinid screams as emote_pitch_variance cannot be changed
      without completely porting the *scream emote to the splurt_module emote.dm
  - tweak: Turned down emote delay from 1 second to 0.5 so players can spam *meow
      obnoxiously.
