  - rscadd: Added glass gas mask into loadout.
  - tweak: 'Renames trencher gas masks around: "trencher gas mask" -> "operative trencher
      gas mask" and "stripped trencher gas mask" -> "trencher gas mask", also modifies
      description. Otherwise, values are unchanged.'
  - rscadd: With that said, added trencher gas mask into loadout. You can still acquire
      it in-round by hacking Clothesmate as usual.
